Retail Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering
Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a K-means clustering algorithm to segment customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. Customer segmentation is crucial for understanding the distinct groups within a customer base, allowing for targeted marketing strategies, personalized services, and improved customer satisfaction.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains customer purchase history, including features such as:

Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer
Purchase Amount: Total amount spent by the customer
Purchase Frequency: Number of purchases made by the customer
Average Purchase Value: Average amount spent per purchase
Recency: Time since the last purchase

K-Means Clustering
K-means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that is widely used for partitioning a dataset into distinct groups or clusters. The primary objective is to divide the data points into K clusters where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
